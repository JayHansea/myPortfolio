                    Hi there, Let's skip the name part, since you already know that.
                    
                    Iâ€™m an enthusiastic software developer specializing in web design and development, graphic design, mobile app development and also content development.
                    
                    Over the years I have found a new love for anything digital and making technology easy to use and accessible to everyone (feels good to do good right?).ðŸ™Œ I've worked and mastered libraries and frameworks like bootstrap and react respectively.
                    
                    Over the past years, Iâ€™ve had the privilege to work on some fantastic projects , one being the UNESCO YouthMobile project while working at the McAnderson Institute of Technology MIT.
                    
                    However, when Iâ€™m not behind my pc, you could find me in a cocktail bar, chilling with friends.
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Feel free to <a id="acon" href="contact.html">contact</a> me.
