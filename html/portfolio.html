            <p>Two strings str1 and str2 are called isomorphic if there is a one to one mapping possible for every character of str1 to every character of str2.</p>
            <p>An app that checks two strings s and t, to determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.</p>  <p>For example,"egg" and "add" are isomorphic, "foo" and "bar" are not, “paper” and “title” are isomorphic.</p>

              <p>Non-repeating character app is an app that takes a string which will contain only
              alphabetic characters and spaces, and return the first non-repeating character (click on image to visit site).</p>
              <p id="eg">Example:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Input: "abcdef"</li>
                  <li>Output: a</li>
                  <li> Input: "hello world hi hey"</li>
                  <li> Output: w</li>

            <p>Scale Balancer is an app that contains two elements, the first being the two positive integer weights on a balance scale (left and right sides) and the second element being a list of available weights as positive integers. Your goal is to determine if you can balance the scale by using the least amount of weights from the list, but using at most only 2 weights (click on image to visit site).</p>
            <p id="eg">Example:</p>
            <p>if a scale is "5, 9" for the first input and "1, 2, 6, 7" for the second, then this means there is a balance scale with a weight of 5 on the left side and 9 on the right side. It is, in fact, possible to balance this scale by adding a 6 to the left side from the list of weights and adding a 2 to the right side. Both scales will now equal 11 and they are perfectly balanced. Your program should return a comma separated string of the weights that were used from the list in ascending order, so for this example, your program should return the string 2,6.</p>

            <!-- <ul>
                <li>The first element of the scale can only contain 2 weights</li>
